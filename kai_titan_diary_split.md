# Kai's Attack on Titan Adventure - Eiken 3 Journey

## Day 1 - Joining the 104th Training Corps (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

Today was my first day! I'm **still** scared but also **excited**. The training camp is **famous** for being hard. This **weekend**, Commander Keith said we will **practice** fighting moves **during** the day. I want to **join** the Scout Regiment (調査兵団, Chōsa Heidan) **soon**, just like the heroes who fight Titans (巨人, Kyojin)!

I **met** many new friends. There's a girl named Luna who is **popular** with everyone **because of** her smile. She wants to **sell** bread after the war, but first we must **leave** our old lives behind. The food here is **cheap** but not **enough**. Luna said we should **look for** extra food in the **garden**.

**then** I saw THEM - Eren, Mikasa, and Armin! They're **different** from us new kids. Eren wants to **show** everyone he can kill all Titans. He will **bring** freedom, he says. Mikasa is **so** strong! Captain Levi might **visit** us and **invite** the best ones to **join** his squad. **how about** that! I must work hard **until** I'm good enough.

Training is **expensive** for the military, so they **plan** to make us strong fast. My **favorite** teacher will **ask** us about **science** tomorrow - how Titans work. **what about** going to the **library** tonight **instead** of playing? Luna might **enjoy** studying with me. Something big will **happen** soon, I can feel it. We're **almost** ready for real training!

But tonight, I'm **sick** from running all day. **by** tomorrow, I hope to feel better!

## Day 2 - The ODM Gear Disaster (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

Today was crazy! We had to **stay** and watch something **important**. **in front of** everyone, Eren tried the ODM gear (立体機動装置, Rittai Kidō Sōchi). He **have to** balance in the air, but he kept falling! His face went red. I **hope** he's okay. We all **need to** learn this or we can't fight Titans!

**later**, at **noon**, we ate **together**. The food was **delicious** - much better than yesterday! Luna and I **decided** to sit with Armin. He said we must **remember** how the gear works. I'm **nervous** about trying it tomorrow. The straps **look** **heavy**. I'll **have to** **carry** my **own** equipment everywhere.

**then** Commander Shadis **showed** us something terrible. **instead** of normal training, he brought pictures from five years ago - when the Colossal Titan (超大型巨人) kicked down Shiganshina's gate and the Armored Titan (鎧の巨人) charged through the inner gate! **what about** those poor people? Eren's mom died there. **because of** that day, Eren wants to kill all Titans. **by** watching his anger **grow**, I understand him better.

Mikasa helped me in the **garden** where we **grow** food. She's quiet but kind. During the **festival** last year (before I joined), she saved many people. On our next **vacation** (if we get one!), I want to visit her hometown. The **weather** there is nice, she says.

I **met** Sasha stealing bread again! She had to **look for** hiding spots. We'll help her tomorrow.

---

## Day 3 - Sasha's Potato Incident (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

I can't **believe** what happened today! **when** we were standing in line, Sasha was eating a potato right **beside** Commander Keith! She even offered him half! **maybe** she's crazy? Keith was **sad** and angry at the same time. He made her run **until** sunset - that's **a lot of** running! I **should** have given her my bread, but I was too scared.

**one day** in **June** (next month), we'll start real combat training. It's going to be **difficult**. Luna is **interested in** learning from Annie - she's **strong** and wins every fight. **usually** Annie stays **over there**, away from everyone. I want to **borrow** her fighting **dictionary** (her notes). She can **hurt** anyone with her special moves. I'm **sure** she'll be in the Military Police.

Today a **bright** light came from the forest - Captain Levi's squad will **arrive** tomorrow! They're testing a **million** yen worth of new equipment. I saw the **clock** - it's late! We must **put** our uniforms in the right **place** or Keith gets mad. Tomorrow we'll **try on** the ODM gear for real. I hope mine doesn't **break**!

Connie **signed** up to be my training partner. He's funny and keeps us **healthy** with jokes. **how often** do we get to laugh here? Not much! But when Sasha ran past us still eating that potato, even Keith almost smiled!

---

## Day 4 - Cooking Duty and Lake Fun (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

Today was **really** fun! I **got** cooking duty with Sasha (of course!). She can **cook** anything and **make** it taste good. We had to **take care of** **lots of** **people** - feeding everyone is hard! The good bread was **already** **sold out** at the market, so we made soup **again**. **sometimes** I **hear** Jean complaining, but even he liked it!

I **look forward to** **July** because that's when summer **season** starts. Armin found **information** about a **lake** nearby. **between** **March** and October, we can swim there! How **exciting**! I **guess** we'll **wear** our old clothes since we don't have swimsuits. Mikasa will **drive** the supply wagon there (she's the best at handling horses).

We had **math** class today - calculating distances for ODM gear. Armin wants to go to **university** someday to study. He can **write** reports and **find** answers so fast! His **face** lights up when he talks about the ocean. He's not **tall** like Reiner, but his brain is huge!

Tonight, we must **pay** for extra food from our allowance. I'll **get** some for Luna too - she helped me **again** with training. She makes everything fun! Even cleaning!

P.S. - Eren and Jean had a food fight! Potatoes everywhere! Levi's squad was visiting and Captain Levi saw the mess. His face was... scary. We cleaned for three hours! But seeing Eren and Jean working together (for once) was worth it!

## Day 5 - Armin's Secret Mission (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

Tonight something **amazing** happened! I couldn't sleep so I went **outside** to think. The sky was full of stars. **behind** the supply shed, I saw a small light. It was Armin with a candle, drawing something on paper!

When he saw me, he looked nervous. "Please don't **tell** anyone," he said. I made a **promise** to **keep** his secret. Then he showed me - he's making a special map! He's been going **around** the camp at night, checking all weak spots in our walls. "We **need to** be ready," he said. "The Titans could come **soon**."

I wanted to **help with** his mission so badly! Armin is so **clever** - not **strong** like Mikasa or **brave** like Eren, but his **mind** is our best weapon. "Can I **bring** you something?" I asked. He needed someone to **watch** while he worked. So now I'm his lookout!

We worked **through** the night. Armin would stop and listen for guards, then **continue** drawing. He **found** three **dangerous** spots where Titans could easily **break** in. "We must use this **information** to **save** everyone," he said. His eyes were so serious!

**after** two hours, we **heard** footsteps. "**quick**, hide!" Armin whispered. We ran into the forest. It was Reiner! But he just smiled and walked **away**. Does he **know** what we're doing? I **wonder**...

---

## Day 5 - Armin's Secret Mission (Part 2)

Armin said tomorrow he'll give the map to Commander Erwin (who's **visit**ing us). This could change everything! But we must act **carefully** - if the **wrong** person finds out, it could be bad for **everyone**. I'm **proud of** Armin! He's going to **become** a great strategist!

I must go now - morning training starts **soon**!

P.S. - Before we left, Armin said something **strange**: "The walls have eyes and ears. Not everyone here is who they **seem**." What does that mean? Is **someone** a spy? I'm scared but also **excited** to be part of Armin's team!

---

## Day 6 - Becoming Armin's Partner   (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

This was the most **important** day of my life! This morning, Armin came to **find** me **during** breakfast. "I **need to** talk to you," he whispered. My heart was beating so **fast**!

We went **behind** the **library** where no one could **hear** us. "Kai," he said, looking serious, "I **trust** you. Will you **become** my partner? I need someone **brave** and **clever** to **help with** my **plan**." I said yes **right away**! 

He showed me three more **dangerous** spots he **found** **yesterday**. "We must **check out** each **place** **carefully**," he explained. "The Titans are getting **strong**er. We **have to** be ready." He gave me a **sign** to use if I see anything **wrong** - I **put** my hand on my heart, then point to the sky.

**after** lunch, we **practiced** our signals. Armin would **show** me different hand movements, and I had to **remember** them all. "If you see **someone** acting **strange**, use this one," he said. It was **difficult** but I **tried** **hard**! We worked **together** **until** it got dark.

**then** something **terrible** happened! While we were **practicing** near the **garden**, we **heard** voices. It was Reiner and Bertholdt, talking in **quiet** tones. "**soon**," Reiner said. "Everything will change." They looked **around** **carefully**, but we **stayed** silent **behind** a wall.

---

## Day 6 - Becoming Armin's Partner   (Part 2)

Armin's **face** went pale. **after** they left, he **told** me: "I **think** they **know** something. We must **watch** them closely. Can you follow Reiner without him **noticing**?" This is a **heavy** responsibility, but I **promised** to do my best.

Later, Armin gave me a small **dictionary** with secret words. "Study these," he said. "From now on, we communicate in **secret**." I'm so **excited** but also **nervous**! **in the future**, I'll be Armin's real sidekick!

P.S. - Armin **believes** the **answer** to **save** humanity is **information**. He says if we can **understand** our **enemy**, we can **win**. I **wonder** what **dangerous** secrets we'll **discover** **together**!

---

## Day 7 - The First Mission (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

Today was **terrible** and **exciting** at the same time! I had to follow Reiner **all day long**, just like Armin asked. **at first**, everything seemed normal - he went to **breakfast**, then to training. But **after** **noon**, things got **strange**.

Reiner **suddenly** stopped **in front of** the old **library** and looked **around**. **Then** he went **inside**. I waited **outside** for a **few** minutes, then followed him **quietly**. He was **behind** a shelf, talking to someone on the other side. I couldn't **see** who it was, but the voice sounded familiar.

"The **plan** must **happen** **soon**," Reiner said. "**Maybe** in **July** or August. We **need to** be ready." The other person said something I couldn't **hear**. Then Reiner said, "**Remember** - no one can **know**. Especially not Eren." My **heart** was beating so **fast**! This was **important** **information**!

I **stayed** **until** they **finished** talking. **when** Reiner left, I **tried** to **see** who the other person was, but they went out the back door. I ran to **find** Armin **right away**. He was **by** the **lake**, studying his **map**.

"Armin!" I whispered. "I **hear**d something bad!" I **told** him everything. His **face** got serious. "This is worse than I **thought**," he said. "We must be **careful**. **From now on**, we **watch** them **every year**."

He gave me a new task: "Tomorrow, **during** training, **try to** **get** close to Bertholdt. **See** if he acts **nervous**. But don't let him **notice** you're watching." I **promised** to do my best.

---

## Day 7 - The First Mission (Part 2)

Before bed, I **practice**d the **secret** **sign**s Armin taught me. If I see danger, I **put** my hand on my **shoulder**. If I need help, I touch my ear. These small things could **save** our lives **one day**.

P.S. - **Sometimes** I **feel** scared. What if Reiner **finds** out I'm watching him? But I **believe** in Armin. **Together**, we'll **protect** **everyone**!

---

## Day 8 - A Close Call (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

**Tonight** was terrifying! I almost got caught spying on Bertholdt. It's **Friday**, and **as usual**, he went to the old building after dinner. I decided to **attend** his secret meeting, hiding **below** the window.

**Suddenly**, I heard my **grandmother**'s voice! No, wait - it was Annie! She can **steal** voices perfectly. "The **date** is set," she said. "**February** 5th. That's when we make our move." My blood ran **cold**. That's only three weeks away!

Bertholdt asked about the **cost** of failure. "We could all **die**," Annie replied. "But it's **too** late to stop now. The **customer** is waiting." Customer? Who are they **working for**?

I needed to get closer to hear more. But when I moved, I knocked over a **piece** of wood. The sound was **loud**! "Someone's there!" Bertholdt shouted. I had to **run away** fast!

I ran toward the **zoo** area where they keep horses. My **grandmother** used to say, "When in trouble, find animals - they'll **protect** you." I hid behind wall and **brush**ed my uniform clean. My heart was beating so hard!

Then I saw Bertholdt with torch, searching. "I **wish** I had my gear," I heard him say. He looked **angry** and **hungry** for answers. I stayed perfectly still, not even breathing.

---

## Day 8 - A Close Call (Part 2)

After what felt like hours, he gave up. "Must have been cat," he said. As he left, he dropped something - a **picture**! I grabbed it after he was gone. It showed **city hall** I didn't recognize, with strange **art** on the buildings.

I ran to find Armin at the **library**. He was there with his **wife** - I mean, not wife! Just Mikasa! (Why did I write that?) They were studying a **local** **map**. When I showed them the **picture**, Armin's face went white.

"This is **international** **attention** we don't want," he said. "This **example** proves they're **working for** someone outside the walls!" Mikasa wanted to tell the **captain** immediately, but Armin said we need more **evidence**.

He gave me a new **task**: "Tomorrow, **ride** to the **station** and send this **letter** to uncle in the capital. He's a **doctor** who understands these things." The **trip** will be dangerous, but I'll do it!

Before bed, I drew the **picture** again in case I lose it. The **umbrella** symbol in the corner seems **important**. **Why** would they use that sign?

P.S. - My **daughter** - I mean, future daughter (I hope!) - would be **be proud of** of me being so brave. Wait, why am I thinking about having a family? Focus, Kai!

---

## Day 9 - Armin's Second Chance (Part 1)

Dear Diary,

Today everything **changed**. I was **planning** to deliver Armin's **letter** to the **station**, but he **stopped** me before I could **leave**. "Kai, we need to **talk**," he said, looking **serious**. "There's something **special** I must **explain**."

He took me to a **quiet** place behind the old **church**. "What if I told you this has all **happened** before?" he asked. At first, I thought he was **joking**, but his eyes were **different** - older somehow, **tired** from carrying **heavy** secrets.

"I've lived through these **events** once already," he said. "Eren becomes a titan, Reiner and Bertholdt are **enemies**, Annie is the Female Titan, and in the **end**..." He stopped, looking **sad**. "Many people **die**. Too many **friends** are **lost**."

I didn't **understand** at first. "Are you **sick**?" I asked. But then he showed me his **notebook** - filled with **details** about things that haven't happened yet! **Names** of people not yet **born**, **dates** of battles not yet **fought**, even **drawings** of titans we haven't **seen**!

"This is my **second** time living through everything," Armin **continued**. "I don't know **why** or **how**, but I **remember** it all. And this time, I want to **save** everyone. But I need to be **careful** - if I **change** too much too **fast**, people might **notice** something's **wrong**."

---

## Day 9 - Armin's Second Chance (Part 2)

"The **problem** is," Armin said, "some things are **already** different. In my first time, you weren't here, Kai. You're **new**. That means this timeline can **definitely** change, but I don't know what will **happen** if I **push** too hard."

He **explained** his **plan**: "We need to **prepare** without being **obvious**. I'll **teach** you things that will **help** later. But we must **act** normal, **especially** around Eren. He's too **honest** - he can't **hide** secrets well."

Then he gave me a **list** of **instructions**: "**Learn** these fighting **moves**. **Study** these **books** about **medicine** and **science**. **Practice** with the gear **every** day, even when **tired**. And most **important** - **watch** Annie carefully. She's more **dangerous** than she **seems**."

I felt **excited** but also **afraid**. "What about Reiner and Bertholdt?" I asked. "Should we **stop** them now?" 

Armin shook his head. "Not yet. If we **move** too **early**, we might make things **worse**. They have **allies** we don't know about. We need to **wait** for the **right** moment."

He then **taught** me a **secret** signal - if he **touches** his **ear** twice during **meetings**, it means danger is **coming** and I should be **ready**. "**Trust** me," he said. "Together we can **fix** this **broken** world."

---

## Day 9 - Armin's Second Chance (Part 3)

Before we **returned** to the **group**, Armin **shared** one more **terrible** truth. "In three **months**, there will be an **attack**. Many **soldiers** will be **hurt**. We need to **collect** medical **supplies** now, but **slowly** so nobody gets **suspicious**."

He gave me **money** to **buy** **bandages** and **medicine** from **different** shops. "**Tell** them it's for your **family**. **Never** buy too much from one **place**." His **planning** was **perfect** - he'd clearly **thought** about this for a **long** time.

When we got back, Eren was **waiting** for us. "Where did you **guys** go?" he asked. Armin **quickly** made up a **story** about **checking** the **schedule** for tomorrow's **training**. Eren **believed** it - he **always** trusts Armin.

At **dinner**, I **watched** everyone differently now. Knowing some are **enemies** makes it **hard** to **smile** and **laugh** with them. But Armin was **right** - we must **pretend** everything is **normal**.

Tonight, I'm **writing** this by **candle** light, thinking about Armin's **burden**. Knowing the **future** but being **unable** to **simply** tell everyone must be **lonely**. I'm **glad** he **chose** to **trust** me with his **secret**.

P.S. - If Armin is **correct**, tomorrow Annie will **beat** Eren in **combat** training. I'll **watch** to see if his **prediction** comes **true**.
