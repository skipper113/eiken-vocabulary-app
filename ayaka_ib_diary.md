# Ayaka's IB Journey - A Japanese Student at Sakura International Academy

*An International Baccalaureate Diary for Eiken Pre-1 Vocabulary*

## Day 1 - The Arrival

I stood at the entrance of Sakura International Academy, my heart beating **terribly** fast. The **modest** brick buildings looked **strictly** academic, nothing like the **informal** schools I'd seen before. My **intent** was clear - I wanted to **end up** at an Australian university studying education.

The campus was **brightly** lit by the morning sun, making everything seem less intimidating. A **sympathetic** teacher noticed me standing there frozen and **pat** me on the shoulder. "You must be Ayaka," she said with **sincere** warmth. "Don't worry, everyone feels this way on their first day."

In the common room, I saw students **quarrel** playfully about which IB subjects were hardest. Some were discussing their **holistic** approach to learning, while others **map out** their study schedules **in order to** manage the workload. I noticed they could all **afford to** speak English so naturally - something I couldn't do yet.

**lately**, I'd been practicing English daily, but hearing them made me realize I needed to **look up to** these fluent speakers and learn from them. The **spontaneous** conversations, the **applause** after someone's presentation - everything felt foreign yet exciting.

My roommate seemed nice but kept to herself. I wanted to **hang on** to my dream of making friends, but my shyness felt **cruel** to my own ambitions. Tomorrow, I promised myself, I would try harder to **invade** my comfort zone and actually talk to someone.

**in contrast** to my old school, this place felt like the beginning of something **replaceable** - my old self transforming into someone new.

## Day 2 - The Roommate's Secret

My alarm didn't work. I woke to my roommate whispering, "Rise and shine!" with an **incredible** British accent. She was already dressed **neat**ly in her uniform, looking **striking** against the morning light streaming through our window.

"I'm Emma," she said with a **frank** smile. "**afterward** the **reception** yesterday, I wanted to **confess** something - I was **eager to** talk to you, but you looked overwhelmed."

I felt my face turn red. "I **intend to** make friends," I stammered, "but my English is **horrible**."

Emma laughed, not in a **nasty** way, but with genuine **warmth**. "What is more, half the students here are struggling with something. See that girl?" She pointed to a **prestigious**-looking student in the **backyard**. "She's **jealous** of anyone who understands **geography** because she can't remember countries. And that **bold** boy who was **boast**ing yesterday? He broke into tears during his first Theory of Knowledge class."

During **interval** between classes, Emma **instruct**ed me on navigating the **vast** campus. The **fountain** in the central courtyard became our meeting spot. She explained how the IB program could **shed light on** different perspectives, how it would **ultimately** **unite** students from different backgrounds.

"This **prestigious** school might seem **harsh**," she said, pulling an **envelope** from her bag. "But look - an **invitation** to the manga club! I saw your **luggage** had anime stickers."

My heart leaped. Someone had noticed something about me beyond my **silence**. In that moment, the **vague** **grief** of leaving home began to **stabilize**. Emma wasn't just a roommate; she was becoming my first real friend.

"Tomorrow," she said, "I'll be your **tutor** for the English presentation. In substance, we're all here to help each other."

## Day 3 - The First Presentation

Emma's tutoring session was **adequate** preparation, but standing in front of the class made me want to **discard** my notes and run. The **fraction** of confidence I'd built up seemed to **vanish** instantly.

"Today's agenda," the teacher announced, "is to declare your Extended Essay topics." My hands began to **tremble** as I watched others proceed with such ease. One student gave a **vivid** description of her **thesis** on climate change, earning **compliment**s from everyone.

When my turn came, I tried to **conceal** my fear. "I want to examine the parallel between Japanese and Australian education systems," I began, my voice barely **audible**. 

"Could you **expand** on that?" the teacher asked, her patience helping me **sustain** my courage.

I took a deep breath and let my passion overflow. I explained how this research could benefit students trying to **immigrate** for education, how it could demonstrate the merits of both systems. My enthusiasm grew as I spoke about wanting to **dedicate** my future to educational reform.

The class began to respond positively. Someone mentioned a document that could help my research. Another offered to translate some Australian policy papers. Their generous support made me realize this wasn't a contest but a collective journey.

After class, the teacher pulled me aside. "Your topic shows real logic," she said. "Don't let language barriers **hinder** your brilliant ideas."

## Day 4 - The Cultural Festival Crisis

The school's annual cultural festival was tomorrow, and our committee was in **chaos**. The principal theme was "Unity in Diversity," but we couldn't settle on our class presentation.

"We should **eliminate** the boring ideas," James said with **excess** confidence. The **dispute** that followed made me **hesitate** to share my proposal.

Emma noticed my reluctance. "Ayaka has an idea," she announced, making everyone gaze at me.

I swallowed hard. "We could **devote** our presentation to showing how different cultures perceive education through art and literature," I suggested. "Each person could **compose** something from their origin country."

"That's brilliant!" someone exclaimed. The atmosphere shifted from tense to excited. We began to **edit** and **refine** the concept, each person contributing their **perspective**.

Working through the night, we created something elegant - a **blend** of prose, poetry, and visual art. My contribution was a delicate piece about the tide of change in Japanese education, written in both languages.

The gradual transformation of our random group into a tight team felt **profound**. When someone made an error, we'd correct it together without **scorn**. The barriers between us began to **dissolve**.

"This exhibition will fascinate everyone," Emma said, looking at our work with pride. "We've created something that will endure in people's memories."

As we finally went to rest, I realized I'd stopped thinking in terms of "them" and "me." We had become "us."

## Day 5 - The Triumph

The morning of the festival, I wore my yukata with **immense** pride. Our reputation was at stake, but I felt calm. The atmosphere buzzed with **acute** excitement as parents and official guests arrived.

Our presentation **surpass**ed all expectations. The audience watched in awe as we demonstrated how education could **embrace** diversity while maintaining academic excellence. My bilingual piece received tremendous praise, with someone calling it "remarkable" and "**sophisticated**."

The principal gave a speech about how we had fulfilled the true spirit of international education. "These students exhibit what it means to adapt and **thrive** in our global community," she said. "They show competence beyond mere language skills."

During the **reception** afterward, a representative from an Australian university approached me. "Your insight on educational comparison is exactly what we seek in future educators," he said, handing me his contact information. "Please consider applying to our program."

I looked around at my classmates - this **diverse** group that had become my **foundation**. Emma squeezed my hand. "You did it," she whispered. "You found your voice."

Standing there, I felt the weight of my journey - from **timid** arrival to confident participant. The IB program had taught me to analyze, to question, to collaborate across cultures. My initial fear had transformed into **determination**.

As the sun set over Sakura International Academy, I wrote in my diary: "Today, I didn't just present a project. I discovered who I could become. This academy gave me more than education - it gave me the courage to **pursue** my dreams without compromise."

The journey continues tomorrow, but tonight, I celebrate this moment of **transformation**.

## Day 6 - A Quiet Weekend

Dear Diary,

This morning I woke up with a terrible **temper**. I think I'm **come down with** a cold - my throat hurts and I can barely speak. Emma called to check on me. "You need to **forgive** yourself for working too hard," she said **sincerely**. She has such **loyalty** as a friend.

I spent the morning in my room, watching smoke rise from the old **chimney** across the street. The cleaning lady found my lost **thumb** drive in the **drawer** - it had all my research notes! I felt such **pity** for myself yesterday when I thought I'd lost everything.

Emma brought me soup and sat **tightly** beside me on the bed. "Your work on **pollution** and **oxygen** levels was brilliant," she said with **tender** care. "Don't let one bad day **overwhelm** you." Her **sympathy** helped me feel better. She even offered to **mend** my torn notebook with tape.

We talked about our dreams. Emma wants to achieve **fame** as a **pioneer** in environmental science. "I'll **utilize** my **scholarship** to make real change," she said. I admitted that academic **framework**s sometimes **intimidate** me. "The **profound** theories make me feel stupid," I confessed.

"That's normal," Emma laughed. "Remember when Professor Mills tried to explain **fertilizer** chemistry? Even he got confused!" We both laughed until we heard my neighbor's dog **bark**. The sound made me think of home - my dog always barks when **spectator**s walk by our house.

Emma stayed until evening. Before leaving, she said something that gave me hope: "Your ideas **complement** mine perfectly. Together, we'll **accumulate** enough evidence to **endorse** our **collaboration**." Her words were like a **spark** - suddenly I felt excited again.

I'm still sick, but I feel better emotionally. Tomorrow I'll be strong enough to face our presentation. Sometimes you need a friend to **tame** your worries and **intrigue** you with possibilities.

## Day 7 - The Presentation

Dear Diary,

Today was the day! Our Theory of Knowledge presentation would be **fatal** if we failed. The **magnitude** of this moment wasn't lost on me - this could be a **genuine** turning point.

The morning started badly. James, our team's third member, showed **hostile** behavior toward Emma. "Your ideas are too **optimistic**," he said, ready to **condemn** our work. He wanted to **revise** everything at the last minute. Emma remained **rational**, but I could see her **suppress** her anger.

"We cannot **tolerate** this **obstacle**," I said, trying to **remedy** the situation. "Our **mutual** respect matters more than individual opinions." James had a **prejudice** against Eastern philosophy, calling it "not **feasible** for academic discourse." His **rigid** thinking made me want to **discharge** him from our team!

But Emma showed **noble** character. "Let's **speculate** on what the judges want," she suggested. "They value **subtle** arguments and **conclusive** evidence." Her **humble** approach helped us **comprise** a solution. We would **sacrifice** some details but keep our core **hypothesis**.

The presentation room felt **oppressive**. The panel included **prominent** professors known for their **scrutiny**. My hands were shaking as I began. The **preliminary** questions were **durable** - lasting forty minutes! One professor tried to **persist** in finding errors, but we managed to **suspend** his doubts.

Then came the **essential** moment. Professor Chen asked about **inherent** flaws in Western epistemology. This was **relevant** to my research! I explained how **neglect** of indigenous knowledge creates problems. The **gravity** of my statement made everyone pause. Had I been too bold?

Suddenly, the head judge smiled. "Your **perspective** is **exempt** from the usual criticism," she said. Our argument would **prevail**! The **outcome** exceeded our wildest dreams - they called our work a potential **breakthrough** with **vital** implications.

Walking out, James finally **apologize**d. "I **deem** your work **essential**," he admitted. The **triumph** felt unreal. Emma hugged me tightly. "We're going to the **summit** conference!" she exclaimed. Our **prosperity** in this program was assured.

Tonight, I **persist** in feeling proud of this **venture**. The **epidemic** of narrow thinking in academia needs voices like ours!

## Day 8 - The New Beginning

Dear Diary,

After yesterday's **triumph**, today brought unexpected challenges. The **summit** conference organizers sent us detailed requirements - we must **submit** a **comprehensive** paper within two weeks! The **magnitude** of this task feels **tremendous**. Our **preliminary** success now seems like just the beginning of a much larger **venture**.

Emma and I met at the library to **constitute** our research plan. "We need to **eliminate** any **ambiguous** points," she said, her **enthusiasm** still strong despite the **overwhelming** workload. We decided to **allocate** specific tasks - I would **accumulate** data on Eastern philosophies while she would **investigate** Western **methodology**. Our **collaboration** felt natural now, our **partnership** growing stronger.

Professor Chen offered to **supervise** our work. "Your **perspective** could **revolutionize** how we **perceive** cultural **dynamics**," he said. His **confidence** in us was both exciting and **intimidating**. He suggested we **utilize** the university's **sophisticated** research database to **strengthen** our **framework**. "Don't be **reluctant** to challenge **conventional** wisdom," he advised.

James approached us with a **solemn** expression. "I want to **contribute**," he said. "My **attitude** yesterday was wrong." His **genuine** apology showed real **transformation**. We decided to **integrate** him into our team properly. His **expertise** in statistics could help us **demonstrate** our points with **concrete** evidence. This **unexpected** alliance might **enhance** our work significantly.

The library was quiet as we worked. I could **distinguish** the soft sounds of pages turning, keyboards clicking. The **atmosphere** was perfect for deep thinking. As I researched, I discovered **controversial** theories that could **complement** our thesis. Some scholars **dispute** the very **foundation** of cross-cultural studies, calling them **inadequate** for capturing true **diversity**.

During lunch, we discussed our **strategy**. "We must **anticipate** criticism," Emma noted. "Some will **perceive** our work as too **radical**." James suggested we **implement** a balanced approach - **acknowledge** opposing views while maintaining our **unique** position. This **compromise** seemed wise. We would **transcend** simple East-West **comparisons** and explore something deeper.

By evening, I felt **exhausted** but **optimistic**. Our **requirement** list was long, but **manageable**. The **opportunity** to present at an **international** conference felt **surreal**. My parents called, their voices full of pride. "Your **dedication** inspires us," Mom said. Their **support** gives me **strength**.

Tomorrow we meet with the debate team to **practice** our presentation skills. The **competition** will be fierce, but I'm not **nervous** anymore. This **journey** has taught me to **embrace** challenges rather than fear them. Our **goal** is clear: to create something **meaningful** that **transcends** academic **boundaries**.
