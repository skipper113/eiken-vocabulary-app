# Ayaka's IB Journey - A Japanese Student at Sakura International Academy

*An International Baccalaureate Diary for Eiken Pre-1 Vocabulary*

## Day 1 - The Arrival

I stood at the entrance of Sakura International Academy, my heart beating **terribly** fast. The **modest** brick buildings looked **strictly** academic, nothing like the **informal** schools I'd seen before. My **intent** was clear - I wanted to **end up** at an Australian university studying education.

The campus was **brightly** lit by the morning sun, making everything seem less intimidating. A **sympathetic** teacher noticed me standing there frozen and **pat** me on the shoulder. "You must be Ayaka," she said with **sincere** warmth. "Don't worry, everyone feels this way on their first day."

In the common room, I saw students **quarrel** playfully about which IB subjects were hardest. Some were discussing their **holistic** approach to learning, while others **map out** their study schedules **in order to** manage the workload. I noticed they could all **afford to** speak English so naturally - something I couldn't do yet.

**Lately**, I'd been practicing English daily, but hearing them made me realize I needed to **look up to** these fluent speakers and learn from them. The **spontaneous** conversations, the **applause** after someone's presentation - everything felt foreign yet exciting.

My roommate seemed nice but kept to herself. I wanted to **hang on** to my dream of making friends, but my shyness felt **cruel** to my own ambitions. Tomorrow, I promised myself, I would try harder to **invade** my comfort zone and actually talk to someone.

**In contrast** to my old school, this place felt like the beginning of something **replaceable** - my old self transforming into someone new.

## Day 2 - The Roommate's Secret

My alarm didn't work. I woke to my roommate whispering, "**Rise and shine**!" with an **incredible** British accent. She was already dressed **neat**ly in her uniform, looking **striking** against the morning light streaming through our window.

"I'm Emma," she said with a **frank** smile. "**Afterward** the **reception** yesterday, I wanted to **confess** something - I was **eager to** talk to you, but you looked overwhelmed."

I felt my face turn red. "I **intend to** make friends," I stammered, "but my English is **horrible**."

Emma laughed, not in a **nasty** way, but with genuine **warmth**. "**What is more**, half the students here are struggling with something. See that girl?" She pointed to a **prestigious**-looking student in the **backyard**. "She's **jealous** of anyone who understands **geography** because she can't remember countries. And that **bold** boy who was **boast**ing yesterday? He **broke into tears** during his first Theory of Knowledge class."

During **interval** between classes, Emma **instruct**ed me on navigating the **vast** campus. The **fountain** in the central courtyard became our meeting spot. She explained how the IB program could **shed light on** different perspectives, how it would **ultimately** **unite** students from different backgrounds.

"This **prestigious** school might seem **harsh**," she said, pulling an **envelope** from her bag. "But look - an **invitation** to the manga club! I saw your **luggage** had anime stickers."

My heart **leap**ed. Someone had noticed something about me beyond my **silence**. In that moment, the **vague** **grief** of leaving home began to **stabilize**. Emma wasn't just a roommate; she was becoming my first real friend.

"Tomorrow," she said, "I'll be your **tutor** for the English presentation. **In substance**, we're all here to help each other."

## Day 3 - The First Presentation

Emma's tutoring session was **adequate** preparation, but standing in front of the class made me want to **discard** my notes and run. The **fraction** of confidence I'd built up seemed to **vanish** instantly.

"Today's agenda," the teacher announced, "is to declare your Extended Essay topics." My hands began to **tremble** as I watched others proceed with such ease. One student gave a **vivid** description of her **thesis** on climate change, earning **compliment**s from everyone.

When my turn came, I tried to **conceal** my fear. "I want to examine the parallel between Japanese and Australian education systems," I began, my voice barely **audible**. 

"Could you **expand** on that?" the teacher asked, her patience helping me **sustain** my courage.

I took a deep breath and let my passion overflow. I explained how this research could benefit students trying to **immigrate** for education, how it could demonstrate the merits of both systems. My enthusiasm grew as I spoke about wanting to **dedicate** my future to educational reform.

The class began to respond positively. Someone mentioned a document that could help my research. Another offered to translate some Australian policy papers. Their generous support made me realize this wasn't a contest but a collective journey.

After class, the teacher pulled me aside. "Your topic shows real logic," she said. "Don't let language barriers **hinder** your brilliant ideas."

## Day 4 - The Cultural Festival Crisis

The school's annual cultural festival was tomorrow, and our committee was in **chaos**. The principal theme was "Unity in Diversity," but we couldn't settle on our class presentation.

"We should **eliminate** the boring ideas," James said with **excess** confidence. The **dispute** that followed made me **hesitate** to share my proposal.

Emma noticed my reluctance. "Ayaka has an idea," she announced, making everyone gaze at me.

I swallowed hard. "We could **devote** our presentation to showing how different cultures perceive education through art and literature," I suggested. "Each person could **compose** something from their origin country."

"That's brilliant!" someone exclaimed. The atmosphere shifted from tense to excited. We began to **edit** and **refine** the concept, each person contributing their **perspective**.

Working through the night, we created something elegant - a **blend** of prose, poetry, and visual art. My contribution was a delicate piece about the tide of change in Japanese education, written in both languages.

The gradual transformation of our random group into a tight team felt **profound**. When someone made an error, we'd correct it together without **scorn**. The barriers between us began to **dissolve**.

"This exhibition will fascinate everyone," Emma said, looking at our work with pride. "We've created something that will endure in people's memories."

As we finally went to rest, I realized I'd stopped thinking in terms of "them" and "me." We had become "us."

## Day 5 - The Triumph

The morning of the festival, I wore my yukata with **immense** pride. Our reputation was at stake, but I felt calm. The atmosphere buzzed with **acute** excitement as parents and official guests arrived.

Our presentation **surpass**ed all expectations. The audience watched in awe as we demonstrated how education could **embrace** diversity while maintaining academic excellence. My bilingual piece received tremendous praise, with someone calling it "remarkable" and "**sophisticated**."

The principal gave a speech about how we had fulfilled the true spirit of international education. "These students exhibit what it means to adapt and **thrive** in our global community," she said. "They show competence beyond mere language skills."

During the **reception** afterward, a representative from an Australian university approached me. "Your insight on educational comparison is exactly what we seek in future educators," he said, handing me his contact information. "Please consider applying to our program."

I looked around at my classmates - this **diverse** group that had become my **foundation**. Emma squeezed my hand. "You did it," she whispered. "You found your voice."

Standing there, I felt the weight of my journey - from **timid** arrival to confident participant. The IB program had taught me to analyze, to question, to collaborate across cultures. My initial fear had transformed into **determination**.

As the sun set over Sakura International Academy, I wrote in my diary: "Today, I didn't just present a project. I discovered who I could become. This academy gave me more than education - it gave me the courage to **pursue** my dreams without compromise."

The journey continues tomorrow, but tonight, I celebrate this moment of **transformation**.

## Day 6 - Weekend Research Mission

Dear Diary,

Saturday morning brought an **unexpected** message from Emma. "The library has **exclusive** access to the Oxford archives this weekend. Want to **investigate** together?" My heart raced - this was a rare **opportunity** to **strengthen** our Theory of Knowledge presentation!

The **prestigious** university library **intimidated** me at first. The **atmosphere** was so **solemn**, filled with **scholars** conducting **profound** research. Emma, however, moved with **confidence**, having **utilized** these resources before.

We discovered **controversial** documents about **indigenous** knowledge systems that would **enhance** our **thesis**. "This **evidence** could **revolutionize** our argument," Emma whispered, her eyes bright with **enthusiasm**. The **implications** were **tremendous** - we could **demonstrate** how **conventional** academic **frameworks** often **suppress** **alternative** ways of knowing.

Hours passed unnoticed as we **analyzed** each source. The **complexity** was **overwhelming**, but Emma's **collaborative** approach made it **manageable**. "Your **perspective** on Eastern philosophy **complements** my Western **methodology** perfectly," she noted. This **mutual** respect had become the **foundation** of our **partnership**.

A **distinguished** professor approached us, **intrigued** by our research. "Your **hypothesis** shows remarkable **sophistication**," he said, offering to **facilitate** a meeting with the head of **anthropology**. This **endorsement** felt **surreal** - were we really making an **authentic** **contribution** to academic **discourse**?

By evening, we had **accumulated** enough material to **transform** our presentation completely. The **exhaustion** was worth it - we had **transcended** the basic **requirements** and created something **innovative**.

Tomorrow, we **implement** our findings. The **anticipation** is almost **unbearable**!
