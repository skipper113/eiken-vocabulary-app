## Day 1 - Joining the 104th Training Corps

Dear Diary,

Today was my first day! I'm **still** scared but also **excited**. The training camp is **famous** for being hard. This **weekend**, Commander Keith said we will **practice** fighting moves **during** the day. I want to **join** the Scout Regiment (調査兵団, Chōsa Heidan) **soon**, just like the heroes who fight Titans (巨人, Kyojin)!

I **met** many new friends. There's a girl named Luna who is **popular** with everyone **because of** her smile. She wants to **sell** bread after the war, but first we must **leave** our old lives behind. The food here is **cheap** but not **enough**. Luna said we should **look for** extra food in the **garden**.

**then** I saw THEM - Eren, Mikasa, and Armin! They're **different** from us new kids. Eren wants to **show** everyone he can kill all Titans. He will **bring** freedom, he says. Mikasa is **so** strong! Captain Levi might **visit** us and **invite** the best ones to **join** his squad. **how about** that! I must work hard **until** I'm good enough.

Training is **expensive** for the military, so they **plan** to make us strong fast. My **favorite** teacher will **ask** us about **science** tomorrow - how Titans work. **what about** going to the **library** tonight **instead** of playing? Luna might **enjoy** studying with me. Something big will **happen** soon, I can feel it. We're **almost** ready for real training!

But tonight, I'm **sick** from running all day. **by** tomorrow, I hope to feel better!

P.S. - Jean (everyone calls him "horse face") keeps arguing with Eren. It's funny but also scary when they fight!

## Day 2 - The ODM Gear Disaster

Dear Diary,

Today was crazy! We had to **stay** and watch something **important**. **in front of** everyone, Eren tried the ODM gear (立体機動装置, Rittai Kidō Sōchi). He **have to** balance in the air, but he kept falling! His face went red. I **hope** he's okay. We all **need to** learn this or we can't fight Titans!

**later**, at **noon**, we ate **together**. The food was **delicious** - much better than yesterday! Luna and I **decided** to sit with Armin. He said we must **remember** how the gear works. I'm **nervous** about trying it tomorrow. The straps **look** **heavy**. I'll **have to** **carry** my **own** equipment everywhere.

**then** Commander Shadis **showed** us something terrible. **instead** of normal training, he brought pictures from five years ago - when the Colossal Titan (超大型巨人) kicked down Shiganshina's gate and the Armored Titan (鎧の巨人) charged through the inner gate! **what about** those poor people? Eren's mom died there. **because of** that day, Eren wants to kill all Titans. **by** watching his anger **grow**, I understand him better.

Mikasa helped me in the **garden** where we **grow** food. She's quiet but kind. During the **festival** last year (before I joined), she saved many people. On our next **vacation** (if we get one!), I want to visit her hometown. The **weather** there is nice, she says.

I **met** Sasha stealing bread again! She had to **look for** hiding spots. We'll help her tomorrow.

P.S. - Secret: Eren's gear was broken! That's why he failed! Keith knew but wanted to test Eren's determination. When Eren got working gear, he balanced perfectly! Amazing!

## Day 3 - Sasha's Potato Incident

Dear Diary,

I can't **believe** what happened today! **when** we were standing in line, Sasha was eating a potato right **beside** Commander Keith! She even offered him half! **maybe** she's crazy? Keith was **sad** and angry at the same time. He made her run **until** sunset - that's **a lot of** running! I **should** have given her my bread, but I was too scared.

**one day** in **June** (next month), we'll start real combat training. It's going to be **difficult**. Luna is **interested in** learning from Annie - she's **strong** and wins every fight. **usually** Annie stays **over there**, away from everyone. I want to **borrow** her fighting **dictionary** (her notes). She can **hurt** anyone with her special moves. I'm **sure** she'll be in the Military Police.

Today a **bright** light came from the forest - Captain Levi's squad will **arrive** tomorrow! They're testing a **million** yen worth of new equipment. I saw the **clock** - it's late! We must **put** our uniforms in the right **place** or Keith gets mad. Tomorrow we'll **try on** the ODM gear for real. I hope mine doesn't **break**!

Connie **signed** up to be my training partner. He's funny and keeps us **healthy** with jokes. **how often** do we get to laugh here? Not much! But when Sasha ran past us still eating that potato, even Keith almost smiled!

P.S. - Reiner and Bertholdt are so nice! They help everyone. Reiner is like a big brother. Nobody knows they're from the same hometown as Annie. They seem sad when people talk about the wall being broken...

## Day 4 - Cooking Duty and Lake Fun

Dear Diary,

Today was **really** fun! I **got** cooking duty with Sasha (of course!). She can **cook** anything and **make** it taste good. We had to **take care of** **lots of** **people** - feeding everyone is hard! The good bread was **already** **sold out** at the market, so we made soup **again**. **sometimes** I **hear** Jean complaining, but even he liked it!

I **look forward to** **July** because that's when summer **season** starts. Armin found **information** about a **lake** nearby. **between** **March** and October, we can swim there! How **exciting**! I **guess** we'll **wear** our old clothes since we don't have swimsuits. Mikasa will **drive** the supply wagon there (she's the best at handling horses).

We had **math** class today - calculating distances for ODM gear. Armin wants to go to **university** someday to study. He can **write** reports and **find** answers so fast! His **face** lights up when he talks about the ocean. He's not **tall** like Reiner, but his brain is huge!

Tonight, we must **pay** for extra food from our allowance. I'll **get** some for Luna too - she helped me **again** with training. She makes everything fun! Even cleaning!

P.S. - Eren and Jean had a food fight! Potatoes everywhere! Levi's squad was visiting and Captain Levi saw the mess. His face was... scary. We cleaned for three hours! But seeing Eren and Jean working together (for once) was worth it!

## Day 5 - Armin's Secret Mission

Dear Diary,

Tonight something **amazing** happened! I couldn't sleep so I went **outside** to think. The sky was full of stars. **behind** the supply shed, I saw a small light. It was Armin with a candle, drawing something on paper!

When he saw me, he looked nervous. "Please don't **tell** anyone," he said. I made a **promise** to **keep** his secret. Then he showed me - he's making a special map! He's been going **around** the camp at night, checking all weak spots in our walls. "We **need to** be ready," he said. "The Titans could come **soon**."

I wanted to **help with** his mission so badly! Armin is so **clever** - not **strong** like Mikasa or **brave** like Eren, but his **mind** is our best weapon. "Can I **bring** you something?" I asked. He needed someone to **watch** while he worked. So now I'm his lookout!

We worked **through** the night. Armin would stop and listen for guards, then **continue** drawing. He **found** three **dangerous** spots where Titans could easily **break** in. "We must use this **information** to **save** everyone," he said. His eyes were so serious!

**after** two hours, we **heard** footsteps. "**quick**, hide!" Armin whispered. We ran into the forest. It was Reiner! But he just smiled and walked **away**. Does he **know** what we're doing? I **wonder**...

Armin said tomorrow he'll give the map to Commander Erwin (who's **visit**ing us). This could change everything! But we must act **carefully** - if the **wrong** person finds out, it could be bad for **everyone**. I'm **proud of** Armin! He's going to **become** a great strategist!

I must go now - morning training starts **soon**!

P.S. - Before we left, Armin said something **strange**: "The walls have eyes and ears. Not everyone here is who they **seem**." What does that mean? Is **someone** a spy? I'm scared but also **excited** to be part of Armin's team!

## Day 6 - Becoming Armin's Partner  

Dear Diary,

This was the most **important** day of my life! This morning, Armin came to **find** me **during** breakfast. "I **need to** talk to you," he whispered. My heart was beating so **fast**!

We went **behind** the **library** where no one could **hear** us. "Kai," he said, looking serious, "I **trust** you. Will you **become** my partner? I need someone **brave** and **clever** to **help with** my **plan**." I said yes **right away**! 

He showed me three more **dangerous** spots he **found** **yesterday**. "We must **check out** each **place** **carefully**," he explained. "The Titans are getting **strong**er. We **have to** be ready." He gave me a **sign** to use if I see anything **wrong** - I **put** my hand on my heart, then point to the sky.

**after** lunch, we **practiced** our signals. Armin would **show** me different hand movements, and I had to **remember** them all. "If you see **someone** acting **strange**, use this one," he said. It was **difficult** but I **tried** **hard**! We worked **together** **until** it got dark.

**then** something **terrible** happened! While we were **practicing** near the **garden**, we **heard** voices. It was Reiner and Bertholdt, talking in **quiet** tones. "**soon**," Reiner said. "Everything will change." They looked **around** **carefully**, but we **stayed** silent **behind** a wall.

Armin's **face** went pale. **after** they left, he **told** me: "I **think** they **know** something. We must **watch** them closely. Can you follow Reiner without him **noticing**?" This is a **heavy** responsibility, but I **promised** to do my best.

Later, Armin gave me a small **dictionary** with secret words. "Study these," he said. "From now on, we communicate in **secret**." I'm so **excited** but also **nervous**! **in the future**, I'll be Armin's real sidekick!

P.S. - Armin **believes** the **answer** to **save** humanity is **information**. He says if we can **understand** our **enemy**, we can **win**. I **wonder** what **dangerous** secrets we'll **discover** **together**!

## Day 7 - The First Mission

Dear Diary,

Today was **terrible** and **exciting** at the same time! I had to follow Reiner **all day long**, just like Armin asked. **at first**, everything seemed normal - he went to **breakfast**, then to training. But **after** **noon**, things got **strange**.

Reiner **suddenly** stopped **in front of** the old **library** and looked **around**. **Then** he went **inside**. I waited **outside** for a **few** minutes, then followed him **quietly**. He was **behind** a shelf, talking to someone on the other side. I couldn't **see** who it was, but the voice sounded familiar.

"The **plan** must **happen** **soon**," Reiner said. "**Maybe** in **July** or August. We **need to** be ready." The other person said something I couldn't **hear**. Then Reiner said, "**Remember** - no one can **know**. Especially not Eren." My **heart** was beating so **fast**! This was **important** **information**!

I **stayed** **until** they **finished** talking. **when** Reiner left, I **tried** to **see** who the other person was, but they went out the back door. I ran to **find** Armin **right away**. He was **by** the **lake**, studying his **map**.

"Armin!" I whispered. "I **hear**d something bad!" I **told** him everything. His **face** got serious. "This is worse than I **thought**," he said. "We must be **careful**. **From now on**, we **watch** them **every year**."

He gave me a new task: "Tomorrow, **during** training, **try to** **get** close to Bertholdt. **See** if he acts **nervous**. But don't let him **notice** you're watching." I **promised** to do my best.

Before bed, I **practice**d the **secret** **sign**s Armin taught me. If I see danger, I **put** my hand on my **shoulder**. If I need help, I touch my ear. These small things could **save** our lives **one day**.

P.S. - **Sometimes** I **feel** scared. What if Reiner **find**s out I'm watching him? But I **believe** in Armin. **Together**, we'll **protect** **everyone**!
