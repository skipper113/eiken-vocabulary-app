## Day 1 - The Disappearance

April 7th, 2024
Tokyo Metropolitan University, Quantum Physics Building

Something is wrong with reality.

This morning started like any other **semester** at TMU. I was reviewing my **hypothesis** for tomorrow's presentation when Professor Yamada walked past my desk. Nothing unusual, except he walked past again. And again. The exact same walk, the same coffee stain on his shirt, the same words to his **contractor** about fixing the lab equipment.

I'm **skeptical** by nature - you have to be in quantum physics. But after the third loop, I started recording on my phone. The **subsequent** replay confirmed what I feared: a seven-second time loop, occurring every 23 minutes. The implications were impossible to ignore.

My roommate Yuki thinks I'm being **biased toward** finding patterns where none exist. She's studying **organic** chemistry and believes everything has a **narrative** that makes sense. But she didn't see what happened in the cafeteria. A student's **disappearance** - literally vanishing mid-bite of her sandwich. The **stark** reality hit me: our campus has become an experiment.

I discovered something in the old **archaeological** section of the library. A **doctrine** from 1952, written by a professor who claimed the university was built on an "anomaly point." His research was dismissed as controversial, but his notes mention "**proliferation** of temporal disturbances" and "**contamination** of local space-time." The university **supposedly** covered it up to maintain its **credibility**.

The administration sent out an **exclusive** email to physics students, asking us to **resume** normal activities and not spread "unfounded rumors." Their **refusal** to acknowledge the loops feels **tragic**. Dr. Chen, who's usually **sympathetic** to student concerns, won't even **dissent** when I bring evidence. It's as if something has **implant**ed the need for silence in everyone's minds.

I've started keeping this diary **alongside** my regular notes. If these disturbances are **consistently** happening, I need proof. Tomorrow, I plan to **round up** other students who've noticed the anomalies. We must **believe in** finding answers before this phenomenon spreads beyond campus.

The night is growing stranger. My laptop's **accounting** software just calculated that I've lived this hour twice. I need **nourishment** - haven't eaten since morning - but I'm afraid to leave my room. What if I disappear like that girl?

**Hold over** - someone's knocking. It's 3 AM. Nobody should be awake.

It's me. At the door. Another me.

## Day 2 - The Other Me

April 8th, 2024
My Dorm Room / Physics Lab / ???

I didn't sleep. How could I, with another version of myself sitting across the room?

She - I? - looked exhausted, wearing clothes I don't own yet. "I'm from three days ahead," she said, her **conscience** heavy with **guilt**. "I came back to warn you, but the **dilemma** is that telling you might **give rise to** worse problems."

Her **philosophical** explanation made my head spin. In her timeline, a **catalyst** event tomorrow would **initiate** a complete breakdown of space-time at the university. The **foremost** physicist studying this, Dr. Sato, would **perish** trying to **circumvent** the expanding anomaly. The administration's attempt to **smooth over** the crisis would only **provoke** more chaos.

"The **organism** causing this," she continued, "isn't from our dimension. It feeds on temporal **enzyme**s - yes, that's a thing. The **scarcity** of normal time flow here attracted it. We need to **work out** how to stop it before the military decides on **expulsion** through nuclear means."

I felt **empathy** for her desperation. The **inherent** danger was clear. But could I trust myself? What if this was some **counterfeit** version, created by the anomaly to manipulate me?

She sensed my **bias**. "**In person**, I know this seems impossible. But watch." She showed me her student ID - expiration date: three days from now. Her phone showed news articles about the university's "gas leak" evacuation that hadn't happened yet.

We decided to **pack up** essential equipment and **roll up** the campus maps to find the source. Other-me said the epicenter was **seemingly** random, but there was a pattern - every location had **fertile** ground for quantum experiments. The **removal** of certain lab equipment might help, but we needed to be **compliant** with whoever was orchestrating this.

In the **behavioral** sciences building, we found evidence that someone had been conducting illegal experiments on perception and reality. A **petition** for research funding had been rejected, leading to underground work. The **rebellion** against ethical guidelines had opened a door that couldn't be closed.

Other-me suddenly grabbed my arm. "We need to leave. Now." Through the window, I saw why - a **protective** barrier was forming around the building, like reality itself was creating antibodies. Students inside were frozen mid-step, caught in temporal amber.

We ran to the old **residence** hall, now abandoned. In the basement, we found it - a makeshift lab with **counterfeit** university equipment. On the wall, someone had written: "Time is just another **segment** of space. Why should we **obey** its rules?"

"This is where it starts," Other-me whispered. "Or ends. Depending on your **conception** of causality."

The equipment hummed with an unnatural resonance. I had to make a choice: trust my future self and shut it down, risking paradox, or let events unfold as they did in her timeline.

My hands shook as I reached for the power switch...

## Day 3 - The Awakening

April 9th, 2024
The Abandoned Lab / My Mind Palace

I touched the switch. Everything changed.

The moment my fingers made contact, memories flooded back - not from my future, but from my **ancestral** past. My grandmother's **disappointment** when I first stopped time at age seven. My mother's attempt to **conceal** our family secret through **forcible** medication. The **multitude** of **unconscious** times I'd bent reality, only to have the memories suppressed.

Other-me smiled sadly. "You were never normal, Reiko. The university didn't create the anomaly - it was drawn here by you."

The **harsh** truth hit me: I am a Chrono-Seer, one of the few humans with **inherent** quantum perception. My family had tried to **surrender** this power to normalcy, but it was like trying to **integrate** oil with water. The **benevolent** facade of my childhood doctors had hidden their true purpose - to **exploit** my abilities for military research.

"Your powers are **on the rise**," Other-me explained. "The suppressants are wearing off. That's why you can see the loops, the disappearances. You're not observing the anomaly - you're creating it unconsciously."

I wanted to **ridicule** her, to **rule out** this possibility. But deep down, the **bleak** reality resonated. Every **conspicuous** event had occurred near me. The **medieval** machine in this lab wasn't causing distortions - it was built to **comprise** and amplify my abilities.

Dr. Tanaka, the **cynical** **surgeon** who'd operated on me as a child, had left **inadequate** notes that I now understood: "Subject shows **favorable** response to temporal manipulation. **Warrant** issued for continued observation through **undergraduate** years."

The machine began to **decay** before our eyes, its purpose **solely** to **spur** my awakening now complete. I felt the **spite** of those who'd controlled me transform into determination. No more **captivity** of my mind.

"Watch," I told Other-me, and for the first time consciously, I reached out with my mind. Time didn't just slow - it became **tangible**, like silk I could weave. I could **expedite** certain moments, **level off** others. The **compensation** for years of suppression was this moment of pure clarity.

But power comes with cost. Each use would **routinely** tear at the fabric of reality. The **misfortune** wasn't the anomaly - it was that they'd awakened something that should have stayed dormant. I could **renovate** time itself, but at what price?

Other-me began to fade. "You're starting to **integrate** the timelines," she said with **appreciation**. "But beware - there are others. The **ruling** council of Chrono-Seers will come. They don't take kindly to wild talents."

As she vanished, I stood alone with my truth. I'd spent years as a **tutor** to myself, teaching quantum physics to understand what I inherently was. The **destitute** feeling of being different had been replaced by terrible purpose.

Tomorrow, I would **put forth** a new plan. Not to stop the anomaly, but to master it. To **repay** those who'd caged me with the very power they'd tried to steal.

The **reminder** on my phone buzzed: "Physics presentation at 9 AM."

I laughed. How trivial that seemed now.

## Day 4 - The Council

April 10th, 2024
Tokyo Metropolitan University - Quantum Lab

They came at dawn.

Three figures in **crisp** suits materialized in my dorm room, their presence **formidable** enough to **weaken** my newly awakened defenses. The leader, a woman with eyes that seemed to **comprehend** centuries, spoke with **paramount** authority.

"Reiko Tanaka. The Council requires your **adoption** into our ranks. Your **inheritance** cannot remain **unstable**."

I wanted to **plead** ignorance, but they could sense my power like **thermal** radiation. The **magnitude** of what I'd become was still **minimal** compared to them, yet they treated me as a threat.

"Your **violation** of temporal laws has caused **devastation** across multiple timelines," she continued. "The **continuation** of your uncontrolled experiments could **evoke** an **epoch** of **discord**."

**Ironically**, I'd spent years studying quantum physics to understand something I was born with. Now these people wanted to **elevate** me to their level - or eliminate me. There was no middle ground in their **tyranny**.

"**Jump at** our offer," the second figure said, his voice **sincere** yet threatening. "The alternative is... **instructive** for others who refuse."

I felt the **infectious** nature of their power trying to **blend in** with mine, attempting to **portray** me as willing. But my grandmother's **loyalty** to our family's independence flowed through my veins. I wouldn't **surrender** to their **multinational** organization so easily.

"You **dread** what you don't control," I said, my voice **moderately** steady. "My abilities **surpass** your traditional methods. That's why you're really here."

The third figure, who had remained silent, suddenly moved. Time didn't slow - it fractured. I saw a thousand possible futures in that moment, each more **spectacular** than the last. In one, I joined them and became their weapon. In another, I fought and lost, my consciousness scattered across the **wilderness** of space-time.

But in one timeline - just one - I saw myself standing free, having discovered something they feared: the **microbial** origins of our power, the **metabolism** of time itself that could be altered at the genetic level.

"**Stick with** your current path," I told them, feeling **awkward** but determined, "and you'll force me to reveal what I've learned about the **geology** layers where Chrono-Seer remains were found. The **nitrogen** isotopes tell an interesting story about our **scarce** origins."

Their composure cracked. They hadn't expected me to **keep up on** the archaeological research, to know about the **tolerant** bacteria that first carried our mutation millions of years ago.

"**Hold up**," the leader said, her authority wavering. "You couldn't possibly—"

"**Reside** in ignorance if you want," I interrupted. "But I know we're not human evolution. We're something else. Something that doesn't belong here."

The room fell silent. Outside, students walked to morning classes, unaware that beings who could rewrite their entire existence were **stand over** them, deciding their fate.

Finally, the leader spoke: "You have seventy-two hours. Learn control, or we intervene. And Reiko... some knowledge is too dangerous even for us."

They vanished, leaving only the faint smell of ozone and the crushing weight of truth: I wasn't just different. I was part of something ancient, something that predated humanity itself.

My phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number: "The bacteria remember. Find Subject Zero."

## Day 5 - Subject Zero

April 11th, 2024
Underground Research Archive - Building 7 Basement

The **administrative** records were hidden behind a **deliberate** maze of red tape, but my newfound abilities made short work of security systems. Time manipulation is **aptly** suited for bypassing locks - you simply rewind them to before they were engaged.

Dr. Yamamoto, my quantum physics professor, was waiting in the **cramped** archive room. His **willingness** to help surprised me until I saw his eyes - the same temporal shimmer I now recognized in mirrors.

"You're one of us," I breathed.

"Not exactly," he said, his voice **strictly** controlled. "I'm what you might call... **defective**. My powers are **premature**ly burned out. Too much experimentation in my youth." He gestured to the dense collection of files. "But I can still help you find what the Council wants to **prohibit** you from discovering."

We worked through **appalling** records of human experiments, **anecdotal** evidence the government tried to **whitewash**. The **mortality** rate among early Chrono-Seers was **disastrous** - most couldn't **hold out** against the temporal pressure and simply... ceased.

Then I found it. File designation: **COSMIC**-001. Subject Zero.

The photographs were from 1952. A **parasite** - that's what they called it - discovered in **Antarctic** ice, perfectly preserved for millions of years. But it wasn't a parasite. It was **intrinsic** to human evolution, a **progressive** mutation that had been dormant until radiation from nuclear tests awakened it.

"The **hierarchy** doesn't want you to know," Yamamoto said, pulling out a **durable** metal case. "Inside is a **replicate** of the original organism. They tried to **put an end to** the research, but one scientist preserved this sample."

I opened it carefully. Inside, suspended in a specialized medium, was something that looked **ugly** at first glance - a writhing mass of bio-matter that seemed to exist in multiple timelines simultaneously. But as I watched, it began to **multiply**, creating fractal patterns that were hauntingly beautiful.

"It's not alien," Yamamoto explained. "It's Earth's natural defense mechanism. When the planet faces **adverse** conditions - meteor impacts, climate change, **eruption**s - this organism awakens in certain humans, giving them the power to manipulate time and potentially save the species."

The implications were **cosmic** in scale. We weren't anomalies or mistakes. We were Earth's **contingency** plan.

"The Council knows this," he continued. "They've built their **exclusive** **fraternity** around controlling who gets activated. They **sue** anyone who tries to expose the truth, cause their **dismissal** from positions, even **stab** them in the back professionally. Some have faced worse - **slaughter**ed to keep the secret."

I touched the container, and immediately felt the organism respond. My **diagnosis** was confirmed - I wasn't just a Chrono-Seer. I was directly connected to Subject Zero, possibly its strongest host in generations. The organism began to glow, pulsing with bioluminescent light.

"They'll **supplant** the current order if they can control you," Yamamoto warned. "Your power could **envelop** the entire planet in a temporal field. That's not **feasible** for them to allow."

Suddenly, alarms blared. The Council had found us.

"Go!" Yamamoto shouted, pressing a **warranty** document into my hand. "This proves everything! The original contract between the government and the first Chrono-Seers. It's legally binding and **profitable** to whoever holds it!"

As security forces surrounded the building, I did something I'd never attempted before. I didn't just stop time - I splintered it, creating multiple versions of myself across different moments. Each one took a different exit, carrying copies of the evidence.

The last thing I heard before temporal displacement was Yamamoto's voice: "Find the others like you! The **despicable** truth is that there are hundreds, maybe thousands, waiting to awaken!"

I emerged on the university roof, all timelines converging back into one. In my hand, the organism's container pulsed with otherworldly light. I wasn't just carrying evidence anymore.

I was carrying humanity's future.
